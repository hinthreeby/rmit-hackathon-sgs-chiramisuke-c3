1. Objective
Refine, debug, and enhance the Climate Change Card Game to make it visually appealing, educational, and fully functional across browsers.
The focus is on improving user experience, gameplay clarity, animations, and educational impact while keeping the code lightweight and front-end only (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). Now, we need to improve its design quality, smoothness, and educational feel.
2. Visual & Layout Enhancements
- Center main elements (cards, buttons, scores) vertically and horizontally.
- Use a clean and modern color palette
- Smoothly animate card flips or transitions
- Ensure fonts are easy to read and thematic 
3. Code Quality & Optimization
- Clean up any redundant variables or repeated code in script.js.
